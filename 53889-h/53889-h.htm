<h2>TO THE RATEPAYERS OF ST. MARYLEBONE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Field of Battle</span> is in sight at
last!&nbsp; The St. Marylebone Mental Light Columns, escorted by
Troops of Progress in bright armour, with Advancement in
Knowledge Rifle Corps, fair women, and brave men, are in marching
order, and eager for the fray with the Mental Darkness Brigade,
the cruel and relentless enemies of Improvement.&nbsp; The
Obstructive Forces for the defence of <span
class="smcap">Ignorance</span>, with a great flourish of
trumpets, proclaiming themselves friends of the poor par
excellence, are marching in defile, and scenting the battle afar
off.</p>
<p>These bitter and unscrupulous foes, who care as much for the
Poor, as their pretended and hollow friend, Judas Iscariot, who
when he cried aloud for the public, meant only himself, of whom
it was said, &ldquo;not that he cared for the poor, but because
he carried the bag,&rdquo; who murmured at the waste of costly
ointment of spikenard with which Mary had anointed the feet of
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and treacherously asked
&ldquo;why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and
given to the poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These determined opponents of Progress&mdash;Parish
Magnates&mdash;who dread the light of intelligence, and whose
excessive desire to guard the ratepayers&rsquo; pockets is
suspicious, and reminds me of Judas&rsquo; anxiety to trade on
the distress of the poor.&nbsp; This Ignorant Phalanx, officered
by pompous little great men, or loud little foolish
men,&mdash;small vanities and pomposities, whose cry is
&ldquo;more taxation,&rdquo; and who seem to say, &ldquo;I am the
Parish,&rdquo; and <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;when I speak let no dog bark;&rdquo; all these
small politicians and miserable <span
class="GutSmall">DO-NOTHINGS</span> are making ready for the
field.</p>
<p>A motley group are these specious Antagonists!&nbsp; Frantic
about the Ballot, clinging to some Utopian impracticable reform,
these sciolists and pedagogues presume to snarl at the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, and denounce him as a financial jobber, wishing
to float every stranding newspaper with public money, and who
speak of our foremost Statesman and his Bill for the repeal of
the Paper Duty, &ldquo;as a sop to that <i>Cerberus</i>, the
Press, to get the support of the newspapers of the
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; What skimbleskamble stuff!&nbsp; Consistent
only in its inconsistency, true to its base, diabolical
instincts, the <i>Times</i> with the malice of Disraeli, and the
hypocrisy of the Tempter, so far from supporting, positively
revels in slandering this <span
class="GutSmall">CONSCIENTIOUS</span> Minister.&nbsp; Yes, the
veering, versatile, infamous <i>Times</i> faithful to one
principle only&mdash;unprincipled wickedness exerts every nerve
to retain this obnoxious tax.&nbsp; It has assailed the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and vilified his policy with a
vindictiveness which <i>Shylock</i> might have envied, and which
even cheap journalism disdained.&nbsp; Parish officials who ought
to know better, prose about the danger of innovation.&nbsp; Not
too fast.&nbsp; Slow and sure.&nbsp; No complaints; no mischief
has yet taken place; stay till it has taken place!&nbsp; <i>Wait
a little this is not the time</i>!&nbsp; With pretended friends
of Progress the right time will never arrive;&mdash;<i>to-day</i>
is the plea, <i>exclusion</i> the object.&nbsp; I admit your
&ldquo;Poor rate is enormous,&rdquo; but I rest my case on this
fact, as a strong argument for adopting this humanizing Act of
Parliament.</p>
<p>All these insidious foes either ignore or misrepresent the
objects and purposes of the <span class="smcap">Public
Libraries&rsquo; Act</span>.&nbsp; Miserable economists in the
guise of friends of poor-rate defaulters, (whose talk about the
Lisson Grove Sunday nuisance is vain and hypocritical, while
opposing Lord Chelmsford&rsquo;s Bill, who have not the courage
to say, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe in the education of those
who have to work,&rdquo;) make use of the ratepayers to pare down
necessary <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Parochial expenditure, and to cry down the wisest outlay
of the Public money, in order to place themselves in office, and
who on the utterly fallacious plea that a half-penny Library Rate
is a compulsory and oppressive tax, would artfully dissuade you
from supporting the News Rooms Act on its own merits.&nbsp; Know
Nothings, and Dreamers, whose emblem is,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Man never IS,
but always TO BE, blest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;candid friends,&rdquo; coarse but not witty, seeking in
every possible way to disparage this beneficent project, in
short, <span class="GutSmall">PRETENDED AND HOLLOW</span> friends
of the poor, who, like the arch traitor in the text <span
class="smcap">care not one straw for the good of the
People</span>, are going on to meet the armed men, the soldiers
of victory, thrice armed as having their cause, or <i>casus
belli</i> just.</p>
<p>But unlike other encounters, in this Engagement there will be
no gathering tears and tremblings of distress.&nbsp; The heroic
women of St. Marylebone especially, will take comfort in the
thought that fortune favours the brave, and that although the
race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong,
they have, come what may, <i>deserved</i> success, for they have
done what they could to win the battle.</p>
<p>Clad in the armour of Righteousness you will know no fear; you
will mock at fear and not be affrighted; you will meet the
treacherous foe with self-approving smiles; Conscience will
whisper in your ears the memorable words of the <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span> to Mary, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">She hath done what she could</span>&rdquo; to
secure the victory.</p>
<p>I have said this Public Library movement&mdash;this precious
boon of Reading for All is especially a <span
class="smcap">Woman&rsquo;s Question</span>, and I hope the
Meeting will be graced by many Ladies to attest its truth and do
honour to this great occasion.&nbsp; With such powerful allies I
for one have no fear of the result.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From woman&rsquo;s eyes this doctrine I
derive,<br />
They sparkle still the true Promethean fire;<br />
They are the books, the arts, the academies<br />
That show, contain and nourish all the world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>I have
briefly alluded to the economic aspect of this question, and
shewn how pauperism would be diminished by the advance of the
people in Knowledge.&nbsp; You may depend upon it nothing is so
expensive to this Parish, so burdensome on the rates as <span
class="smcap">Ignorance</span> and <span
class="smcap">Inebriety</span>.&nbsp; I have designated the
Public Libraries Act as a scheme for reducing the rates by
improving the condition of the people.&nbsp; Let me for one
moment turn from the &pound; <i>s.</i> <i>d.</i> point of view,
to the social.&nbsp; What power in <span
class="GutSmall">BOOKS</span>!&nbsp; What various knowledge in
those great Public Instructors, <span
class="GutSmall">NEWSPAPERS</span>!&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span> be thanked for Books!</p>
<p>No matter how poor I am, no matter if the rich will not enter
my obscure dwelling.&nbsp; If the oldest and most precious of all
books, the <span class="GutSmall">BIBLE</span>, with its
unparalleled wisdom, with its unrivalled English, and its
unequalled and incomparable Poetry is my companion and familiar
friend,&mdash;if <span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>, the
first of uninspired writers, still enchants me with his presence,
and the witty <span class="smcap">Sydney Smith</span>, (whom
bigots, with their little learning but enormous arrogance,
stigmatize &ldquo;irreligious&rdquo;) preaches to me with his
practical wisdom; though languid perhaps with toil I shall not
pine for want of intellectual associates, and I may become
lettered, though entirely excluded from other
companionship.&nbsp; What humanizing tendencies in Books, and how
imperceptibly they influence the habits and tastes of the
Public!&nbsp; Do what you can then to satisfy this increasing
thirst for intelligence, and the cultivation of the intellect,
and you will enlarge the field of remunerative employment, you
will open up the avenues to honourable and congenial occupation
to young women, whom the narrow existing labour market fails to
find bread, let alone the means of support.&nbsp; But, remember
it will be an uphill fight, for there must be two to one in
favour of this <i>permissive</i>, and not compulsory Act, and no
poll can be demanded.</p>
<p>To the best of my ability I have set it forward; and to you I
now remit this <span class="GutSmall">WOMAN&rsquo;S</span>
question, believing as I do that despite conventional frowns or
sneers, you will, like the youthful David, valorously shoot down
this giant ignorance that is desolating our land, and that with
the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>shield
of <span class="smcap">Bellew</span>, <span class="smcap">Tout
d&rsquo;en haut</span> (All from on High, from Above, from the
Father of Lights,) you will triumph in a cause second to none in
its economic and social bearings.</p>
<p>I use no unmeaning phrase when I again assure the Ladies of
St. Marylebone that in inviting them to take part in this
conflict, on the issue of which so much depends, in asking them
to come out and separate themselves from the vain, and frivolous,
and heartless, I invite them to no unfeminine or unbecoming
action.&nbsp; Believe me the time has come when you must throw
off indecorous reserve and squeamishness, that is if you really
desire to do good and raise yourselves on the social ladder, if
you really desire to be released from the terrible bondage of
<span class="GutSmall">GOVERNESSING</span>, or the cruel
servitude of <span class="GutSmall">DRESS MAKING</span>.&nbsp;
You are <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> called upon to lead
Troops, or to Preach, or to make public speeches about
Woman&rsquo;s rights, but <span class="GutSmall">YOU ARE</span>
earnestly entreated to <span class="GutSmall">SAVE
YOURSELVES</span>, to agitate this subject started by a
distinguished political writer, viz.: &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">WHAT WILL THE WOMEN DO NEXT</span>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Take fast hold then of this Public Library question, agitate it
with nothing but your humanities about you, and the time is not
distant when the field of profitable employment for young women
shall be considerably widened.&nbsp; That civilization must be
very imperfect, extremely smooth and artificial, which selfishly
permits and tyrannically decrees that the kitchen, and the
nursery, the workroom and the factory shall entirely absorb
energies which might be much more usefully directed.&nbsp; Mr.
John Bennett, so honourably identified with the cause of progress
and social reform, urges the importance of National Instruction
as a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>, without which it is vain to
expect English women to compete with the Swiss in watchwork, and
discloses the humiliating fact that the number of uneducated
women in England, as ascertained by the signing of the marriage
register was, one-third greater than that of men, and that out of
nearly 80,000 women who were married, 68,175 <i>could not write
their names</i>, but had to sign the register thus, + &ldquo;her
cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely this is not a state of things to be
proud of, there is no ground here for boasting and <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>glorification,
and the condition of England, as a <i>Nation</i>, wholly
uneducated, is in strong contrast to that of the Swiss
population, where all the means and appliances of education of
the highest character are to be found even in the remotest
village.</p>
<p>When doctors disagree I will not presume to decide as to the
necessity of granting medical diplomas to women, but why not
&ldquo;Women and Watch-work?&rdquo;&nbsp; Is the Swiss girl more
naturally artistic than the English?&nbsp; Is she more
capable?&nbsp; Certainly not.&nbsp; It is instruction alone which
constitutes her superiority.&nbsp; Let a woman be employed in
that branch of industry for which she is adapted.&nbsp; Why there
are parts of a watch which a woman can finish far better than the
best workman.&nbsp; Talk of negro slavery, the tyranny of the
workshop is more odious, more hateful in every respect.&nbsp; But
I rejoice to perceive the dawn of a brighter day when a truer and
higher civilization will threw open the doors of <i>Watch
Manufactories</i> and <i>Printing Offices</i> to English
women.</p>
<p>Ladies of St. Marylebone, I invite you to attend the Public
Library Meeting at the Literary Institution, 17, Edwards Street,
Portman Square, at 12 o&rsquo;clock at noon, on Monday 18th June,
1860.</p>
<p>On this vital question I counsel you to throw off the absurd
trammels and customs of fashion.&nbsp; The law allows you to vote
for the Libraries Act, and I warn you that if you persist in
clinging to delusion, if you permit yourselves to be overcome by
indifference and listlessness,&mdash;if you &ldquo;likes to be
despised,&rdquo; and prefer being tied and bound by the chains of
fashion,&mdash;the day will come when you will bitterly repent
such fastidious and disdainful behaviour.&nbsp; Read <span
class="smcap">Anna Jameson&rsquo;s</span> &ldquo;Communion of
Labour.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prisons, Reformatories, Schools, Hospitals,
Workhouses, all engaged the attention of this noble person.&nbsp;
Like Florence Nightingale she was in every sense a model
woman.&nbsp; Yet those eyes, beaming with intelligence, have now
lost their lustre, and are for ever closed, and the hand that
wrote that admirable pamphlet is mouldering in its shroud.&nbsp;
But though dead, she still speaks to you in terms more eloquent
than any I can use.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Anna Jameson</span>
would say to you, &ldquo;Be true to <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>yourselves and naught shall make you
rue.&rdquo;&nbsp; Believe me the custom of confining women to
mean, or trifling pursuits is</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A
custom<br />
More honour&rsquo;d in the breach, than the
observance.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You who may be so powerful in society, why should you remain
powerless?&nbsp; Why not <i>do what you can</i> to slay this
Demon Ignorance in St. Marylebone?&nbsp; Why should Central
Africa and other far off Missions engross your <span
class="GutSmall">FIRST</span> attention?&nbsp; I exhort you to
attend this Library Meeting, and <i>take your part in this good
work</i>.</p>
<p>Yes, vote for an Act which will bring silent, yet most
interesting companions, <span class="GutSmall">BOOKS</span> to
your Homes!&nbsp; But do not too curiously and haughtily enquire,
as is the wont of some, &ldquo;Who is the chief Promoter of this
movement?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">NON
QUO</span>,<span class="GutSmall"> SED QUO MODO</span>, <i>Not
who</i>, <i>but how</i>,&rdquo; must be your battle cry.&nbsp; Be
swayed by <i>arguments</i>, rather than by authority.&nbsp;
Consider <i>what is said</i>, <i>not who says it</i>; never mind
whether he has, or has not a bank account.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O what a world of vile ill-favour&rsquo;d
faults<br />
Looks handsome in six hundred pounds a year!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, hold up your hands for the adoption of the Libraries Act,
and in the hour of death, when the world and its allurements are
receding from your view, when alone and deserted by your
so-called friends, how it will console you in that solemn moment
to be sensible that you have obeyed the voice of <span
class="GutSmall">HIM</span> who spake as never man spoke, that
you gladly took the advice of your <span
class="GutSmall">ASCENDED LORD</span> to &ldquo;make to
yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ah! think of eyes so young, obscured, and darkened by tears, that
you will thus make clear and glad!&nbsp; On your vote the
question may be determined, and the hour has struck when you
should be leaders, and not the slaves, of opinion.</p>
<p>It is meet and right that you should <span
class="GutSmall">LEAD</span> in a cause which promotes <span
class="GutSmall">EARLY CLOSING</span>, and which would confer in
other ways a real and enduring benefit on your Parish.&nbsp; Hear
the fine thoughts of Festus and treasure them in your
memories.</p>
<p class="gutindent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>&ldquo;Grant this we pray Thee, and
that all who read,<br />
Or utter noble thoughts may make them theirs,<br />
And thank God for them, to the betterment<br />
Of their succeeding life;&mdash;that all who lead<br />
The general sense and taste, too apt, perchance,<br />
To be led, keep in mind the mighty good<br />
They may achieve, and are in conscience, bound,<br />
And duty, to attempt unceasingly,<br />
To compass.&nbsp; Grant us, all-maintaining Sire!<br />
That all the great mechanic aids to toil<br />
Man&rsquo;s skill hath formed, found, rendered,&mdash;whether
used<br />
In multiplying works of mind, or aught<br />

May much avail the human welfare now,<br />
And in all ages henceforth, and for ever.<br />
Let their effect be, Lord! to <span class="GutSmall">LIGHTEN
LABOUR</span>,<br />
And give more room to mind, and leave the Poor<br />
Some time for <span
class="GutSmall">SELF-IMPROVEMENT</span>.&nbsp; Let them not<br
/>
Be forced to grind the bones out of their arms<br />
For bread, but have some space to think and feel<br />
Like moral and immortal creatures.<br />
Look Thou with pity on all lesser crimes,<br />
Thrust on men almost when devoured by want,<br />
Wretchedness, ignorance and outcast life!<br />
Have mercy on the rich, too, who pass by<br />
The means they have at hand to fill their minds<br />
With serviceable knowledge for themselves,<br />
And fellows, and support not the good cause<br />

May Peace, and Industry, and Commerce weld<br />
Into one Land all Nations of the World,<br />

Oh! may all help each other in good things,<br />

lead</i><br />
<span class="smcap">The World</span>, for She is worthiest; and
may all<br />
Profit by her example, and adopt<br />
Her course, wherever great, or free, or just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Lords and Gentlemen, I contend that it is a discredit,
that, in the largest and richest Parish in the Metropolis, and in
the United Kingdom, there is not only not a vestige of a free
public News Room, but that St. Marylebone lags behind the poor
Parish of St. John&rsquo;s Westminster, where for upwards of
three years, the <span class="smcap">News Room</span> has been a
source of great attraction.&nbsp; Should you visit this News
Room, in Great Smith Street, the silence, order, and evident
interest of some two hundred readers, <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>must strike you.&nbsp; The conduct of
the frequenters of this Reading Room is very praiseworthy.&nbsp;
I was told of one who came from Highgate, and open as it is to
all comers, in all grades of life, it is pleasant to notice the
influence of the judicious instruction to the librarian, which
Mr. Stuart Dalton first introduced at Liverpool, viz.,
&ldquo;That all persons, however ill-dressed or poor, who are
cleanly, shall be treated as gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the good
ship &ldquo;Westminster,&rdquo; is in danger of being cast away,
of splitting on the dangerous rock, parsimony; she is on a
lea-shore with breakers ahead; signals of distress are flying,
and St. Marylebone will come to the rescue.&nbsp; Yes! this great
and important parish will make an effort to preserve so admirable
a vessel.&nbsp; Let her not founder, when <i>you could save</i>,
let her not go down when you could prevent.&nbsp; I drop the
figure and tell you plainly, that the force of your example in
adopting Mr. Ewart&rsquo;s Act, is <i>much needed</i> by the
Smith Street Institution, which looks to you for encouragement
and sympathy.&nbsp; And not only St. Margaret, but other
Metropolitan Parishes will follow the lead of St.
Marylebone.&nbsp; London, too, will wake from its long lethargic
slumber, and, undismayed by the defeat of 1855, will anxiously
watch how you deal with this question.&nbsp; Lord Mayor Carter
will not imitate his predecessors in frustrating the intentions
of the Legislature; <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a> and although an
enthusiast in Rifle Brigades will find time to summon a meeting
as to the policy of firing a shot at Ignorance, directly St.
Marylebone carries the Act, and affirms that</p>

<p>The working of the Libraries Act in Manchester, has given
great satisfaction.&nbsp; Artists, authors, surgeons, chemists,
lawyers, clerks in, and out of orders, and artizans frequent the
Reading Room.&nbsp; So in Marylebone the Public <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Library would
benefit not one alone, but <span class="GutSmall">ALL</span>
classes.&nbsp; Such an Institution would do something to diminish
that <span class="GutSmall">ISOLATION</span> of class, which the
dying <span class="smcap">Talfourd</span> rightly said was the
bane of England.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is miserable policy in this free country to
allow a dangerous class, utterly uninformed, to grow up in your
very midst:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A savage Horde, among the civilized,<br />
A SERVILE BAND among the LORDLY FREE.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is a perilous experiment.&nbsp; If you do not look after them,
rely on it they will look after you, and when it is &ldquo;too
late,&rdquo; you will deeply regret your ruinous economy, and
short-sightedness, in not doing what you could to soften their
manners, and make them less brutal, and also to qualify them for
the Suffrage by wisely proffering these young Mohawks and
Ojibbeways of Lisson Grove especially, <span
class="GutSmall">INTELLECTUAL IMPLEMENTS AND TOOLS</span>.</p>
<p>In 1858 the rental of the Parish of St. Marylebone, assessed
to the poor rate, was valued at &pound;911,570; this sum at
<i>one halfpenny in the pound</i>, produces &pound;1,899
2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>&nbsp; To speak of an education-rate like
this as an infliction, to describe such an impost as a heavy tax,
is mere rant, and to talk about the <i>thin end of the wedge</i>,
or the &ldquo;last feather,&rdquo; &amp;c., is a mischievous
abuse of language.&nbsp; The inestimable good of <span
class="smcap">Public News Rooms</span> and <span
class="smcap">Lending Libraries</span>, will, despite heavy
platitudes and dreary sophistries, win their way.&nbsp; Take
honest pride in being able to say: I helped by my vote to secure
to St. Marylebone this incalculable benefit, which would be
confined to no one class exclusively, but which would be every
man&rsquo;s possession and every man&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; That
will be a Waterloo day in the social annals of St. Marylebone,
when guided by this magnificent idea, you wisely determine to
establish so excellent an Institution.&nbsp; To such societies as
the Workman&rsquo;s Institute, 209, Euston Road, and the All
Souls&rsquo; Mutual Improvement, Great Portland Street, and to
the &ldquo;Patrons&rdquo; of Sir Benjamin Hall&rsquo;s Pet,
rickety bantling, in Gloucester Place, now happily defunct, to
which I refer, on account of the confusion <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>it caused as
a sham of the first class, To friends of Progress, like Lord
Shaftesbury, <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a> Lord Overstone, Mr. Robert Hanbury,
and Mr. J. Payne, it is fit a few words of remonstrance should be
addressed.&nbsp; Why, year after year repudiate,&mdash;why
perversely ignore the Public Libraries Act?&nbsp; Why disquiet
yourselves in vain?&nbsp; Why set up your puny wisdom against
that of Parliament?&nbsp; Why seek to bolster up ill managed,
cliquish, moribund Institutes?&nbsp; Why this morbid, excessive
anxiety to <span class="smcap">Patronize</span>?&nbsp; That
Patron system so fatal to self-respect, produces sycophants, not
men.</p>
<p>The Rector of All Souls candidly admitted his Institution was
<i>in articulo mortis</i>, and that the higher classes took no
interest in this weak, sickly infant.&nbsp; No doubt the object
is good, but how far wiser for the District Rectors to take up
the amended Act, which applies &ldquo;to Parishes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Take it up <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> in a carping,
criticising, fault finding spirit, but rather <span
class="GutSmall">SUPPLEMENT</span> it, by Concerts, Readings, and
Lectures.&nbsp; G. <span class="smcap">Montague Davis</span>,
<span class="smcap">Esq.</span>, whose recitations exhibit so
much cleverness, informs me, London Lecturers, of no mean talent,
would gladly deliver a course at the St. Marylebone Public
Library. <a name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b"
class="citation">[13b]</a>&nbsp; Supplement it with <span
class="smcap">Recreation</span> and <span
class="smcap">Refreshment</span> Rooms.&nbsp; Never forget the
scope and design of the Act is to <span
class="GutSmall">ATTRACT</span>, <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span> to repel, to <span
class="GutSmall">AMUSE</span>, as well as to instruct, the
people.&nbsp; <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>I will assume that you have carried the Act:&mdash;that
is a good work, but I warn you it is not sufficient.&nbsp; The
Legislature tells you to do the best you can with this enabling
Act.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Supplement</span> it then by all
means, and make the avenues and approaches to your News Rooms
pleasant and entertaining.&nbsp; You will never attract the men
of fustian jackets, and horny hands, unless you can combine
amusement with instruction.&nbsp; I grant that newspaper reading,
as the most effective instrument of public instruction, should be
encouraged as much as possible, but it is no easy matter to go
from ten and twelve hours work in search of useful
knowledge.&nbsp; You must provide good and cheap <span
class="smcap">Recreation</span>.&nbsp; I entertain serious
misgivings that additional Church Accommodation is <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span> the most pressing question of the
day.&nbsp; There is a taste to be formed, and a mind to be
humanized by enjoyment, before Church or Chapel services can be
relished.&nbsp; No doubt books and papers <i>are</i> attractive,
but I am pleading for the man wearied and exhausted by a day of
toil.&nbsp; In a <i>caf&eacute;</i>, in the Rue de la Roquette,
near the Place de la Bastille, Paris, I observed fifty
<i>ouvriers</i> in blouses playing at billiards.&nbsp; All
appeared to be innocently enjoying themselves; why not?&nbsp;
There is no necessary connexion between billiards and gambling,
and the question arises if the Club, or Billiard room is
beneficial or allowable to the Gentleman, why not also to the
Working Man?</p>
<p>To successfully combat the allurements of cabarets and gin
palaces, you must &ldquo;compel&rdquo; men to visit your News
Rooms by the force of superior attraction.</p>
<p>There is &ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">REST</span>&rdquo;
enough, too much, already.&nbsp; Nothing breaks the low and
grovelling monotony of &ldquo;the Pious Public
House.&rdquo;&nbsp; No healthier pursuit interferes with the
recreation supplied by the tap-room, or the sanded parlour.&nbsp;
You must <i>tempt</i> people into churches&mdash;the arguments of
fear have not succeeded in making them frequented.&nbsp; The
excitements you employ are not sufficient to attract the poor to
your benches&mdash;try the effect of supplementing the Act, as I
have briefly indicated&mdash;take it up in this wise temper, and
you will have no dismal failures to lament.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, it is related of the Emperor <span
class="smcap">Augustus</span>&mdash;it <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>was the glory of his reign&mdash;that
he found Rome brick, and that he left it marble.&nbsp; Let it be
your higher aim, your nobler distinction, that you found the
people ignorant, and that you left them <span
class="GutSmall">INSTRUCTED</span>&mdash;that you found them
wholly untaught in <i>political and social science</i>, <a
name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a> and that you left them <span
class="GutSmall">INTELLIGENT</span>&mdash;that you found the
gates of the temple of knowledge closed to the toiling classes,
and that you <span class="GutSmall">OPENED THEM TO
ALL</span>!</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I belong to no Party, but I will yield to none in
my earnest desire to thoroughly <span
class="GutSmall">RESTORE</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">REPAIR</span> the venerable Fabric of the
Constitution, and to put the Representation of the People on a
firm basis, and to have a House of Commons for the common
people.&nbsp; I am for a more comprehensive franchise than the
symbolical one of lath and plaster.&nbsp; I would give a vote to
every man certified as competent to <span
class="GutSmall">READ</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">WRITE</span>.&nbsp; I prefer a representation of
<span class="GutSmall">INTELLIGENT MEN</span> to any Franchise
that can be devised.&nbsp; What claim has an illiterate hind to
the Elective franchise?&nbsp; Not the slightest.&nbsp; You put a
dangerous weapon into his hand of the use of which he is
ignorant.&nbsp; The Suffrage is a <span
class="GutSmall">TRUST</span>, and a man wholly uninstructed is
unqualified to exercise it.&nbsp; Philosophers laugh at
<i>manhood</i> suffrage <i>de se</i>, and ask why should not such
a franchise include women?</p>
<p>I am of opinion that a Reading and Writing qualification is
fairer and more equitable, and affords as good a security for an
honest vote, as any &pound; s. d. franchise whatever.&nbsp; With
an untaxed Press, with Knowledge set free, with cheap and good
Literature, such a suffrage could not fail to stimulate the
popular education.&nbsp; I have no faith in a &pound;6 or a
&pound;5 franchise, unless it is annexed with a reading
certificate, and to make no provision for a &pound;10 or
&pound;12 <span class="smcap">Lodger Franchise</span>, as Mr.
James proposes, seems mean popularity-hunting, and like a
determination on the part of Lord John Russell to ignore the
claims of a very <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>large and respectable class in St. Marylebone, and other
Metropolitan Parishes, because they are quiet and not
demonstrative.&nbsp; But such palpable injustice cannot be
endured for ever.&nbsp; That &ldquo;ugly rush,&rdquo; predicted
by Mr. Henley, may yet come; for there is always danger of
convulsion when large bodies of men are insulted, and deprived of
their just political rights, in order to please the rampant,
degenerate Earl <span class="smcap">Grey</span>, the rank Tory
<span class="smcap">Dictator</span>, alias Renegade Whig, Earl
<span class="smcap">Derby</span>, or such a loud, noisy
Declaimer, as Sir E. Bully Lytton, M.P.</p>
<p>This Hertfordshire Baronet has taken so prominent a part in
the play of <span class="smcap">Reform</span>, in the character
of &ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">THE RENEGADE</span>&mdash;an
<span class="smcap">English Liberal</span>,&rdquo; that it
becomes a duty to briefly criticize the performance.&nbsp; If
there is one spectacle more humiliating, or one sight sadder than
another, it is that of beholding a man of letters, and of
unquestionable ability, laboriously using his talents as a cloak
of maliciousness, and ungratefully reviling that democracy which
gave him bread, and raised him to power.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Et
tu</i>, <i>Brute</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, a more grossly insulting,
unpatriotic speech never issued from the lips of the most rabid
Tory!&nbsp; Can it be possible that &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">England and the English</span>&rdquo; was written
by the &ldquo;Poverty and Passion&rdquo; Orator?&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Quantum mutatus</span>!&nbsp; &ldquo;How is the
gold become dim!&nbsp; How is the most fine gold
changed!&rdquo;&nbsp; How unlike that Bulwer who discoursed so
eloquently of the rights of man&mdash;of man as a greater name
than President, or King!</p>
<p>From my youth up, Bulwer was my <i>beau ideal</i>; he is now
my realization of perfidy and tergiversation, and before such an
elaborate sham, even the star of Disraeli must pale.</p>
<p>Like your confr&egrave;re novelist, Disraeli, you have turned
your back upon yourself, and brought a slur on the literary
calling.&nbsp; You, who began your political career by
associating your name with the freedom of the newspaper from all
fiscal restrictions, end it by doing what you can to hamper and
enchain it.&nbsp; On the night of the third reading of the <span
class="smcap">Paper Duty Repeal Bill</span>, May 8, you absent
yourself from the Division, when <span class="GutSmall">EVERY
VOTE</span> was of the utmost importance to the Finance Minister,
though I am <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>bound to add you were not alone in turning your back
upon yourself, and your speeches about giving the people
education and intelligence.&nbsp; Lord <span
class="smcap">Stanley</span>, with an inconsistency equally
glaring, votes for &pound;300,000 for the Promotion of Education,
and then evades the Repeal Bill Division by flight!&nbsp; I
prefer <span class="smcap">Disraeli&rsquo;s</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Adderley&rsquo;s</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Pakington&rsquo;s</span> adverse vote to such mean,
pusillanimous Absentees, and Patrons of Educational Institutes,
as Lord <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, the Member for
King&rsquo;s Lynn, Sir Robert <span class="smcap">Peel</span>,
the Member for Geneva, and the immaculate <span
class="smcap">John Arthur Roebuck</span>, <a
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17"
class="citation">[17]</a> the stern guardian of Political
Purity.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Stroud</span> will rid itself
of <span class="smcap">Horsman</span>, and the Metropolitan
constituencies of <span class="smcap">Finsbury</span>, <span
class="smcap">St. Marylebone</span>, <span
class="smcap">Southwark</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Westminster</span>, will have something not very
complimentary to whisper to Mr. <span
class="smcap">Duncombe</span>, Mr. <span
class="smcap">James</span>, and Sir De <span class="smcap">Lacy
Evans</span>, who absented themselves from the Division, and to
Sir <span class="smcap">Charles Napier</span>, who voted with the
Noes.&nbsp; If <span class="smcap">Liskeard</span> favours the
absence of Mr. <span class="smcap">Osborne</span> from a Reform
Bill, compared with which a &pound;6 franchise is as nothing in
the scale of moral value, it is time this Cornish borough was
disfranchised.&nbsp; The honourable member for <span
class="smcap">Oldham</span>, I regret to notice, has a legitimate
excuse for his absence, but what can be said of his colleague,
the son of <span class="smcap">Cobbett</span>, voting against
Free Trade in Intelligence and Ingenuity, voting for imposing an
oppressive and restrictive tax of upwards of a million, on an
article which is just as essential to the circulation of
knowledge, as iron rails are to the progress of a locomotive.</p>
<p>In glancing over the Division list, Ayes, 219, Noes, 210, I
was glad to notice <span class="smcap">Birmingham&rsquo;s
</span>indefatigable and respected Representative, <span
class="smcap">William Scholefield</span>, <span
class="smcap">Esq.</span>, among the Ayes; but where was the
staid and &ldquo;eminent&rdquo; member, John Bright, on this
particular night?&nbsp; What!&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The
Tribune</span> of the People to slope <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>away on a field night like
this!&nbsp; Not even to pair!&nbsp; Why <span
class="GutSmall">ASSUME</span> there would be no fight on the
<i>third</i> reading?&nbsp; Had the vote been as decisive as on
the second reading, Lord Derby, with all his ill-concealed
jealousy of the rising influence of Mr. <span
class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, and his antipathy to a cheap
Press, would not have ventured on so desperate a game as the
backer of the Limerick game cock.&nbsp; The Rupert of Debate was
far too wily a tactician to overlook this narrow Party victory,
this dwindling of the Ayes from 53 (245 against 192) to 9, this
narrow squeak, this, in effect, desertion to the enemy.&nbsp;
There is not the shadow of a doubt the wretched <span
class="GutSmall">NINE</span> encouraged the wily strategist in
his dangerous game of <span class="GutSmall">USURPING</span> the
privileges of the Commons, and reviving the ominous cry of 1832,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">What use is the House of
Lords</span>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Observe, far be it from me to comment with severity on the
sayings and doings of the brilliant Quaker.&nbsp; Far be it from
me to notice affronts which I set down to exuberance of
arrogance, often seen in men who have raised themselves from an
obscure position to a front rank.&nbsp; I would much rather dwell
on Mr. Bright&rsquo;s eminent services in the People&rsquo;s
cause.&nbsp; Who was the chief Orator at the great League
Meetings, 1843&ndash;45?&nbsp; Who so captivated by his earnest
style?&nbsp; Fifteen years have elapsed, and again I have
listened to Mr. Bright&rsquo;s persuasive words.&nbsp; His speech
at St. Martin&rsquo;s Hall, May 15th, 1860, was a master-piece,
and, despite a cold, a most animated, yet almost solemn
appeal.&nbsp; I will quote a sentence, which, who that loves his
country will gainsay?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You boast of your love of freedom, your
newspapers fill columns every day with the details of what men
are doing in other parts of the world&mdash;some in overthrowing,
some in building up noble fabrics of human liberty.&nbsp; Let me
beseech you that, whilst you are observing what is being done
ABROAD with an intense and increasing interest, never for a
single moment forget what is being done, and what it is your duty
to do, AT HOME.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bright&rsquo;s reception by the great meeting of some
three thousand persons was indeed an ovation, not &ldquo;a
roomfull of London mob,&rdquo; (as the <i>Times</i> insolently
says), but of an indignant people.&nbsp; As in the days of <span
class="smcap">Kean</span>, <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>&ldquo;the pit rose at him,&rdquo; at
the close of an inciting yet moderate speech, of one hour&rsquo;s
duration.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I exhort the people of England&mdash;you
who are here present to-night&mdash;all who shall read my words
to-morrow, I exhort them to make this a great question.&nbsp;
Your fathers would have made it a great question: they would have
maintained, and did maintain their rights; and you are recreant
and unworthy children of theirs if you surrender them in your
generation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What cares Earl Derby, with his fifty proxies, whether he
throws the country into inextricable confusion? <a
name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; What cares a haughty aristocrat
for Mr. Gladstone?&nbsp; His great superiority of
intellect&mdash;his undaunted courage&mdash;his noble
conscientiousness, are so many thorns in his side, and it is
clear that certain members of both Houses, and envious <span
class="GutSmall">EX</span>-Chancellors, (as Disraeli, or that
renegade sinecurist, Spring Rice, Lord Monteagle&mdash;a servant
of the Crown, yet working against the Crown&mdash;with an office
of &pound;2,000 as Comptroller of the Exchequer, money wrung from
a heavily taxed Public) dislike our honest Finance
Minister.&nbsp; Need I remind you the genius <span
class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span> has displayed as a Financier
is a crime in their eyes.&nbsp; To drive the <span
class="smcap">State</span> Coach at all hazards, what cares <span
class="smcap">Lord Derby</span> if the wheels of his chariot
knock down the great Commoner?&nbsp; What does such a titled
usurper care for offering gross insults to the <span
class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>?&nbsp; To <span
class="GutSmall">OBSTRUCT</span>, to offer every impediment to
the spread of knowledge by means of the Penny <span
class="smcap">Newspaper</span>&mdash;that great political
Intelligence&mdash;is the delight of this chieftain and his
retainers.&nbsp; You then turn round and most insolently taunt
the Poor with their want of knowledge and improvidence, with
their hazy and uncertain political ideas.&nbsp; You tempt the
poor man with bribes, and complain of his <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>dependence in
his exercise of the Franchise, and contemptuously enquire
&ldquo;what will he do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know of no dishonour, no meanness to be compared with
this.&nbsp; You are astute enough in diverting attention from the
<span class="smcap">Reform</span> Bill by unfriendly criticisms
on <span class="smcap">Napoleon</span>, and by the distraction of
Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>You are not Members for Nice or Savoy.&nbsp; To annoy our
<span class="GutSmall">ALLY</span> and impede his policy, the
rights and liberties of <span class="GutSmall">ENGLISHMEN</span>
are to be shelved.&nbsp; Why this excessive anxiety about our
Foreign neighbours to the neglect of <span
class="GutSmall">HOME</span>?&nbsp; I can only glance at the
curious tone of this cynical speech.&nbsp; No doubt the delivery
of this harangue was striking enough, but a roar is certainly not
a melodious sound.&nbsp; The effect of the oration though clothed
in glittering phraseology was entirely lost by the jerking mode
of its delivery.&nbsp; Such a <i>dog</i>matical outcry I never
heard.&nbsp; It resembled the noise of some furious mastiff, and
no wonder the loud barking drove despairing Members into the
lobby.&nbsp; And this wretched declamation Lord B. Manners calls
a brilliant and magnificent oration.&nbsp; There was a time when
<i>Mr. Bulwer</i> could see no evil in a large increase of the
constituency, nor any danger in the ignorance, credulity, and
excitableness of the working classes.&nbsp; There was a time when
he wished to conciliate the &ldquo;English&rdquo; with fulsome
adulation in order to elevate himself, <i>now</i> he labours to
damage and damnify; and who are his associates in adopting the
not very elegant or polite terms of &ldquo;scum,&rdquo;
&ldquo;boor.&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; A <i>Mr. Adam Black</i>, M.P.
for Edinburgh, the son of a journeyman mason, <i>Sidney
Smith</i>, a briefless Edinburgh barrister, <i>Robert
Longfield</i>, an Irish barrister, a Q.C. and Member for Mallow,
and next a brace of Lords, Robert Cecil, and Robert
Montagu.&nbsp; In coarse and vulgar slanders of the Poor who is
such an adept as the man who is a traitor to his order&mdash;the
man who has himself worked for his bread?&nbsp; None are so
bitter and malignant as those who have risen from the
ranks.&nbsp; Let me tell this scion of the House of Rutland that
the presence of <i>Lords</i> in the House of <i>Commons</i> is
not desirable, and that the days of a rapacious <span
class="GutSmall">OLIGARCHY</span> as the real ruling Power in
England are numbered.&nbsp; Why add Insult to Injury?&nbsp; <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>It is a
defence full of peril, to say in effect that your order requires
the people to be deprived of their just Rights.</p>
<p>Let me tell that political incendiary Lord <span
class="smcap">Derby</span> that if his Order can only be upheld
by depriving us of the Elective Franchise, that if his Order
really requires this great sacrifice, this keeping the people
year after year in dense ignorance, that if his Order can only be
preserved by <span class="GutSmall">USURPING</span> the
privileges of the House of Commons, in order to perpetuate an
odious and miserable Tax on Intelligence, I for one exclaim,
Perish this Order.</p>
<p>And here let me contrast the coarse, censorious, anti-Reform
Speeches of Lord R. Cecil, Lord B. Manners, Mr. Bentinck, and
another Aristocrat whose &ldquo;House&rdquo; is quite as
potential for evil, though not so ancient as some noble
Lords.&nbsp; I allude to John Walter of Bear Wood, and Printing
House Square, Member for Berkshire, and the chief Proprietor of
the &ldquo;Times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reading their libellous and defamatory speeches, I thought of
the dreaded advent of that day when plough boys should read and
write, I mused on the countryman&rsquo;s cry, &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">WAIT TILL US CHAPS HAS VOTES</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compare the &ldquo;Oration&rdquo; of Sir E. Lytton, with the
well reasoned, logical speech of <span class="smcap">Mr.
Gladstone</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But when he speaks, what elocution
flows,<br />
Soft as the fleeces of descending snows.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of orators, and master of the arts of Rhetoric, <span
class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span> condescends to dress his
arguments in no robe of tinsel finery, no specious, no glittering
phrases are to be found, but a plain, common sense English speech
that could not fail to make a deep impression on the House.&nbsp;
How the Phantoms alarmists had conjured up were routed!&nbsp; How
he scattered to the winds the hobgoblins the Terrorists had
raised!</p>
<p>Sprung from the People, with them and of them, the <span
class="smcap">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span> is too noble
minded and just to satirize the Poor because they are poor.&nbsp;
I will quote his words:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir.&mdash;I don&rsquo;t admit that the
working man, regarded as an individual, is less worthy of the
suffrage than any other class.&nbsp; I <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>don&rsquo;t admit the charges of
corruption from the Report of a Committee of the House of
Lords.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe that the working men of this
country are possessed of a disposition to tax their neighbours
and exempt themselves, nor do I acknowledge for a moment that
schemes of socialism, of communism, of republicanism, or any
other ideas at variance with the laws and constitution of the
Realm are prevalent and popular among them.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Hear,
hear.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I forget.&nbsp; The Field day is drawing near, and you
will soon be in the thick of the Battle! <a
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Yet once more let me look upon the
scene;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me call to mind my first to the Field of Waterloo, wrapt
in a crimson flood of light, on a beautiful summer&rsquo;s
evening in 1859.&nbsp; Standing upon this celebrated Plain,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;this
place of skulls,<br />
The grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>who can forget the heroic deeds of that never to be forgotten
Field?</p>
<p>Traversing that Plain where united Nations drew the sword, and
where our Countrymen especially triumphed, who cannot sympathize
with the dying English King, who on being told that it was the
18th of June, exclaimed &ldquo;That was a glorious day for
England!&rdquo;&nbsp; But <span class="GutSmall">PEACE</span> has
her victories not less renowned than War.</p>
<p>And I hasten to review some specialities in a Home contest on
which so much is at stake; in my notes on St. Marylebone nothing
has struck me more than the high degree of speciality which
attaches to this Crown Living.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Lancing</span> in <span
class="smcap">Sussex</span>, my native village, of which my
Father was for many years <span class="smcap">Vicar</span>, in
Ecclesiastical language is termed a &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Peculiar</span>,&rdquo; and certainly St.
Marylebone might take the same title.&nbsp; The <span
class="GutSmall">CLERGY</span> in this, as in every other Parish,
stand on a vantage ground, and, if I might venture to speak a few
words, I would counsel them to vote for this Act, and advocate
such <span class="GutSmall">NURSERIES</span> of Intelligence and
virtue as Public News and Recreation Rooms, and to recommend the
rate paying part of their congregations to do the same.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>It
would be very unwise to separate yourselves from the only
feasible plan for the innocent recreation and instruction of the
People, and what have the <i>working</i> clergy to fear from
Books or Newspapers?</p>
<p>Is it wise in the 19th century of the Christian era to
proclaim openly that you dare not encounter the rivalship of
places set apart for intellectual gratification and
amusement?&nbsp; Is it not well occasionally to ask yourselves
whether the common people hear you gladly? and if your words
contain the food, or the medicine which meets the great
necessities of toiling hearts.&nbsp; You have vainly preached
prohibitions and restrictions,&mdash;you have hurled spiritual
thunderbolts with little or no effect.&nbsp; Stand upon the steps
of the Churches, and see who comes out.&nbsp; Is the working man
there?&nbsp; There are clearly faults on both sides.&nbsp; He
loves not the Church.&nbsp; The Church has not done its
duty.&nbsp; You must constrain, tempt, &ldquo;compel&rdquo; him
to enter.&nbsp; You must manage to <i>attract</i> and draw him,
and above all you must learn to preach Freedom of Thought, <span
class="GutSmall">UNITY</span> and <span class="smcap">Christian
Equality</span>.&nbsp; Believe me it would be politic on your
part to review the past, and <i>do what you can</i>, to
ameliorate the condition of the masses by gladly availing
yourselves of this Act.&nbsp; That is a sad day for the Gospel
and the Church when a Plan for the Improvement of the People is
called &ldquo;secular,&rdquo; and not sufficiently religious to
be urged from the Pulpit: the Bishop of <span
class="smcap">Sierra Leone</span> in his Sermon at St. Marylebone
Church drew an appalling picture of &ldquo;1,300 millions of
Idolaters,&rdquo; and spoke of the duty of teaching the Nations,
by spreading abroad the light of the Gospel.&nbsp; That
obligation cannot be questioned, but who can say there are not
<span class="GutSmall">IDOLS</span> of <span
class="GutSmall">SECTARIANISM</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">CASTE</span> in our own country?&nbsp; Who can
say there are not unhappy <span
class="GutSmall">DIVISIONS</span>, and a want of <span
class="GutSmall">CHRISTIAN UNIFORMITY</span>?&nbsp; And who can
deny the Idol worship of <span class="smcap">Lisson
Grove</span>?</p>
<p>Talk of the <i>dark places of the earth</i>, where can more
devoted worshippers of <span class="smcap">Bacchus</span> or of
Mammon be found than in this collection of Towns, called <span
class="smcap">London</span>?&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Here</span> are Idols as real, sacrifices as
hideous and mischievous as any in a heathen land.</p>
<p>I can understand the opposition of the Romanists to <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>this gracious
Act.&nbsp; The Romish system cannot bear the light of
intelligence: Priests of that faith don&rsquo;t want their people
to know too much, or to get as high as the generalities of
history, or the speculations of philosophy, but <span
class="GutSmall">YOU</span>, the Clergy of the Church of England,
that Church which will stand or fall, as it meets the
requirements of this progressive age, have no interest whatever
in keeping the Key of Knowledge to yourselves.&nbsp; Recollect
St. Marylebone has a disgrace to retrieve, a character to
redeem.&nbsp; Believe me it is a discredit to your large Parish
to be without a Public Library.&nbsp; Vote for the adoption of
this Act, and you reduce the Poor rate, you reduce crime, and
simplify the policeman&rsquo;s duty, and above all you bridge
over the gulf that separates classes.&nbsp; Your cordial sympathy
cannot be withheld from a Proposal of this description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him
that bringeth glad tidings, that publisheth <span
class="smcap">Peace</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp; You who promulgate
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Peace</span> on earth, <span
class="GutSmall">GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN</span>,&rdquo; cannot
carelessly regard this beneficent project.&nbsp; You cannot be
more usefully engaged than in promoting a scheme that enlarges
the means of instruction, and widens the field of economical and
sanitary science.&nbsp; Your senses cannot be quite dazzled by
the pomps and vanities of exclusive Rifle Corps, trained to fire
at imaginary foes.&nbsp; You cannot allow this fair land to be
invaded by an enemy so real and fatal as <span
class="smcap">Ignorance</span>.&nbsp; You will not forget what it
is that makes one man wiser, or more virtuous than another, and
what it is that constitutes the difference between one man and
another?&nbsp; You well know what it is that makes them what they
are, good or evil, useful or not.&nbsp; You well know that it is
<span class="smcap">Education</span> which makes the great
difference in mankind. <a name="citation24"></a><a
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; You are too
sagacious to slight, or separate yourselves from the only <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>feasible,
enduring plan for the innocent <span
class="GutSmall">RECREATION</span> and instruction of the
people.&nbsp; You are aware that all work and no innocent <span
class="GutSmall">AMUSEMENT</span>, has been productive of the
worst results.&nbsp; You are aware that Music is a powerful agent
in the promotion of refinement and civilization, and that after a
long day of toil, a man has need of relaxations other than
books.&nbsp; Knowing this, you will, I hope, gladly respond to
the appeal, and strengthen the hands of St. Margaret and St.
John.</p>

<p>I have said St. Marylebone is a <i>peculiar</i> Crown living;
with a Baronet for a Crown Churchwarden.&nbsp; May I ask the
reason why the Rector never takes the chair at Vestry
Meetings?&nbsp; And if not in me too curious, does the Bishop of
London approve of a Clerk in Orders being Preacher, Parish Clerk,
and Sexton?&nbsp; And whether the Rev. official pockets the
Surplice fees as parson, clerk, and sexton?&nbsp; This triple
conjunction of offices is peculiar, and no doubt economic, but it
wants reforming altogether.&nbsp; Such an industrious clerk as
Mr. Braithwaite, might be supposed to have some influence.&nbsp;
But he roughly tells me that he has not any, has never heard, nor
wishes to know, anything of Mr. Ewart&rsquo;s Act.&nbsp; I am
surprised the District Rector of St. Mary, Mr. Gurney, and also
the Incumbent of All Saints, Margaret Street, should have
received a volunteer with so little courtesy.&nbsp; Had I been
engaged in devising some evil, instead of an enduring benefit to
their Parish, I could not have been more cavalierly treated.</p>
<p>I do not say arrogance is confined to <span
class="smcap">Priests</span>.&nbsp; I have met with <span
class="smcap">Popes</span> out of Rome, who in the garb of <span
class="smcap">Friends</span>, or <span class="smcap">Free
Traders</span>, have much Pride, but little Humility, and whose
utter want of common courtesy is in strong contrast to our Old
Nobility.&nbsp; Perhaps the most offensive display of intolerance
was that of a Rt. Rev. Ratepayer, residing in Queen Ann St.,
whose Episcopal ire was roused on being asked to aid in setting
forward the Libraries <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Act. <a name="citation26a"></a><a
href="#footnote26a" class="citation">[26a]</a>&nbsp; Not a very
unreasonable request.&nbsp; A Bishop who daily, I suppose, reads
in his Prayer Book the Collect for <span
class="smcap">Peace</span>, &ldquo;Trusting in <span
class="smcap">Thy</span> Defence, we may not fear the Power of
<span class="GutSmall">ANY</span> adversaries,&rdquo; is so
alarmed, or attaches so little meaning to the words of the
Prayer, that he subscribes handsomely to the Chichester Rifle
Corps, and yet betrays no fear of the invasion of an enemy, more
dangerous and to be dreaded than the French, is certainly not an
agreeable study:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;tant&aelig;ne
animis c&aelig;lestibus ir&aelig;?&rdquo;<br />
Dwells such rancour in heavenly minds?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long years ago when:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;My thoughts were
happier oft than I,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Grey warned the Bishops &ldquo;to set their House in
order.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the Church is not reformed from <span
class="GutSmall">WITHIN</span>, she will be reformed from <span
class="GutSmall">WITHOUT</span>, with a vengeance.&nbsp; It
cannot be denied the sentiments of <span
class="smcap">Festus</span> are held by attached members of the
Church of England.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let not a hundred humble pastors starve,<br

In this or any land of Christendom,<br />
While one or two impalaced, mitred, throned,<br />

<p>The Rector of Christchurch, Lisson Grove, lately advocated the
claims of the Diocesan Church Building Society.&nbsp; No doubt it
is time that something should be done for the Poor of this
District, but I am clearly of <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>opinion that it would be wise to
postpone any efforts in this direction, until the cheap
experiment of Free Libraries had been tried in St.
Marylebone.</p>
<p>Such an Institution in Lisson Grove would to the Ojibbeways
especially be a <i>Home of Refuge</i>, or what I should term a
<span class="GutSmall">SCHOOL CHURCH</span>.&mdash;Good Books are
the best of Missionaries.&nbsp; Parcels of hundred volumes each
at five pounds per parcel, can be purchased of <i>C. Mudie</i>,
511, New Oxford Street; but <span class="GutSmall">CURATES</span>
are not so easily obtained.&nbsp; No Institutions, no
contrivance, no expenditure, can multiply this sacred crop.&nbsp;
As one of the Laity of the Bishop of London&rsquo;s Diocese I own
I demur to additional &ldquo;Buildings&rdquo; unless I have some
voice in reference to the Incumbents, &amp;c.&nbsp; It is time
the Laity &ldquo;assisted&rdquo; &ldquo;Parochial
Extension&rdquo; in other ways besides money contributions.&nbsp;
Why do the Bishops and dignified Clergy persist in <span
class="GutSmall">IGNORING</span> Laymen in their Ecclesiastical
arrangements?&nbsp; Why regard them as mere machines for
extracting gold or silver?&nbsp; Before I can reply to the Bishop
of London&rsquo;s Letter to the Laity of the Diocese, I
respectfully request a satisfactory answer to this
question.&nbsp; Will your Lordship aid the Laity in their just
claim to a seat in Convocation?&nbsp; The Laity are not excluded
from Convocation in the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United
States, and if the laity of the Church of England are to be
rigidly excluded, Church Building appeals will command little, or
no attention.</p>
<p>The Laymen of 1860 are not the unlettered men of twenty years
since, and to deny them any deliberation as to the qualification
of Curates or Incumbents, reading or preaching capabilities,
appears to me very bad policy on the part of our Ecclesiastical
superiors.</p>
<p>It would ill become me to set up as an <i>Episcopus
Episcoporum</i>, believing, however, as I do that this assembling
of the Laity and Clergy would tend to Christian <span
class="smcap">Unity</span> I cannot resist urgently insisting on
this Church Reform.&nbsp; Speaking for my own order the Laity are
hardly dealt with!&nbsp; How many real grievances they must now
silently endure, without the slightest power to remove or abate
them!&nbsp; How much which relates to discipline, and the
conducting <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>the services is diametrically opposed to the wishes of
the Laity!&nbsp; How often has the length of the Morning Service
been objected to.&nbsp; Only the other day Lord <span
class="smcap">Ebury</span> did what he could to shorten the
services, but in vain; there seems a superstitious reverence for
repetition, for retaining certain phrases which must strike high,
low, and broad Churchmen as objectionable.&nbsp; The Prayer for
both Houses of Parliament under our &ldquo;most religious and
gracious Queen&rdquo; is truly admirable, and how any Lords
Spiritual and Temporal can join in such a comprehensive petition
and yet vote against a great Educational boon like the repeal of
the last tax on Knowledge I for one cannot understand.&nbsp; But
in this Prayer I demur to applying the same term &ldquo;most
gracious&rdquo; to the Queen, and to the <span class="smcap">King
of Kings and Lord of Lords</span>.&nbsp; Who can deny that damp,
ill-ventilated, or icy cold Churches, are not fruitful causes of
disease?&nbsp; I attended the Sons of the Clergy Festival, under
the Dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral on the 23rd May.&nbsp; It
was a warm summer&rsquo;s day, but owing to the intense cold
rushing currents of air, I with others was obliged to
leave.&nbsp; People were shivering with cold&mdash;and this in
the 19th century!&nbsp; A boasted scientific age!&nbsp; A few
years ago I was at St. Paul&rsquo;s Sons of the Clergy Festival,
and was then compelled to leave on account of the bitter
cold.&nbsp; I wrote on that occasion a polite note to Dean
Milman, in which I urged that some means of warming the Cathedral
should be adopted.&nbsp; I received no reply; and this is not
surprising, for a more <i>Judaic</i> High Priest&mdash;a very
<i>Caiphas</i> cannot be found than <i>Henry Hart</i>
Milman.&nbsp; Why there might have been some excuse for thus
trifling with the Public health at the time my Grand-father was
Prebendary of this Cathedral, because the appliances of science
were not in his day known.&nbsp; Let me tell this supercilious
Priest that a curious public are enquiring of what use are <span
class="smcap">Deans</span> and <span class="smcap">Canons</span>
with their thousands a year, if they do not even take the trouble
to make their Churches comfortable?&nbsp; It is very
discreditable to the Dean and Canons that such beggarly parsimony
should year after year prevail.&nbsp; Why not <span
class="GutSmall">FREE ACCESS</span> to this noble Edifice?&nbsp;
Why this miserable Clerical <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>impost of 4<i>s</i> 2<i>d</i>?&nbsp;
Why it is an Education of itself to survey</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;until
thy mind hath got by heart<br />
Its eloquent proportions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dome&mdash;the vast and wondrous Dome,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Christopher Wren&rsquo;s rare masterpiece, of whom it was
said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Si
monumentum requiris,<br />
Circurnspice,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;if you want his monument, look around.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This glorious Temple, which stands alone for grandeur, worthiest
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, the Holy and the True,
deserves a better fate than to be starved by its Priests on the
pretext of a false and wretched economy.&nbsp; Every thing that
ministers to comfort is seen in a nobleman&rsquo;s mansion, shall
<span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s House</span> alone be dishonoured
by such paltry and mean frugality?&nbsp; Who can deny the
attendance of invalids at Matins, with litany and communion, is
not itself an ordeal, but to combine this length of Service with
a Sermon of an hour&rsquo;s duration is an infliction of no
ordinary character.&nbsp; I do not say that when <span
class="smcap">Paul</span> has served for a text, that <span
class="smcap">Plato</span> or <span
class="smcap">Epictetus</span> have preached, but who shall say
the Preacher does not too often exhibit himself and <i>his
crude</i> ideas, and <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> the
Bible&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>It is this text of
mine</i>,&rdquo; that too often proceeds from the lips of
ostentatious Preachers.</p>
<p>It is unreasonable to expect that 20,000 clergymen of the
Church of England, are qualified as preachers, shall be able, one
and all, at least twice a week, to talk or read something that
will command attention for fifty or sixty minutes?&nbsp; Why not
some <span class="GutSmall">UNIFORMITY</span> in the Prayer, or
no Prayer, before sermon?&nbsp; Why not some authorized version
of psalms and hymns to be sung in all the churches?&nbsp; Why
this diversity?&nbsp; The layman has a right to say to the
Bishop, if you forbid me to take any part in the government and
discipline of the Church, I cannot contribute towards the
&ldquo;extension&rdquo; of such injustice.&nbsp; You nominate or
appoint a clerk, who <i>ought to know how to read</i>; yet <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>how few are
capable of <span class="GutSmall">MERELY READING</span> the
Service, I will not say with propriety alone, but with common
decency.&nbsp; Who has not &ldquo;suffered some,&rdquo; to use an
American phrase, by the deplorable deficiencies in pronunciation,
and accentuation?&nbsp; Who with any ear for fit cadence, is not
pained to be obliged to listen to the monotonous whining of the
simple and beautiful Ritual of the Church of England?&nbsp; It is
from the reading desk and the pulpit that boys and girls are told
they will hear their mother tongue in all its purity.&nbsp; But
is this true?&nbsp; It is not only not true, but the very reverse
of truth.&nbsp; The forms of Prayer and Thanksgivings, as
literary compositions, are perfect specimens of style.&nbsp; What
English prose will venture to challenge a comparison with the
dignity and melody of the Collects?&nbsp; And yet, remember, the
musical and rhetorical excellence of the Liturgy, consists
chiefly of translations from the Latin!&nbsp; Surely such
persuasive, such affecting petitions to Heaven deserve a better
fate, than to be murdered by ruthless and ignorant men who have
missed their vocation.&nbsp; Some mouth and mutter, some rant and
roar, others simper and squeak, and not a few read the Service
with the same apathy as an animal chewing the cud.</p>
<p>Yet the Laity of the Diocese of London cannot interfere,
cannot even hint to such readers they had better retire.&nbsp;
This overgrown diocese contains two millions and a half of
inhabitants.&nbsp; It is divided into four hundred and
thirty-three parishes, with eight hundred and fifty-five
clergy.&nbsp; Common sense dictates dividing the Diocese of
London.&nbsp; Why not a Bishop of <span
class="smcap">Westminster</span>?&nbsp; Yet not one word can
laymen utter on such topics, in any deliberative church assembly,
and I submit the time has come when all this must be <span
class="GutSmall">REFORMED</span>, and when the Diocese of London
must be at <span class="GutSmall">UNITY</span> in itself. <a
name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>It was my intention to have said a few words about <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Lord John
Russell&rsquo;s scheme of Reform, but I can only just glance with
some pity on his poor little forlorn, tender Bill.&nbsp; I can
only view it as an instalment of better things to come.&nbsp; The
ignoring the claims of &pound;10 or &pound;12 Lodgers in great
London parishes especially, would be an act of extreme injustice,
and I hope in Committee, the Foreign Secretary will adopt this
clause to be proposed by Mr. James.</p>
<p>My extreme anxiety to carry the Libraries Act in St.
Marylebone, must atone for any repetitions of last warning words
to the Ratepayers.&nbsp; Believe me the enemies of Literature, of
innocent, intellectual recreation, are too astute to tolerate
fair, or indeed any, arguments in favour of this most hopeful
Legislative enactment.&nbsp; They are well aware that reason is
too strong for nonsense in the long run, and that if this wise
proposal is argued on its own merits, and not hashed or mixed up
with Parochial extravagance, or misgovernment, and other
extraneous matter, that the ground on which they stand will sink
from beneath them.&nbsp; They tell you &ldquo;this is not the
time to agitate the question,&rdquo; and that it is
&ldquo;inexpedient at present,&rdquo; and will weary you with
some unintelligible jargon about voting against the Act, but at
the same time agreeing to the &ldquo;general
principle!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such miserable, specious excuses are
invariably set up in all cases which will not bear the force of
argument.&nbsp; The <i>right time</i> with such mean
obstructives, let me assure you, will <span
class="GutSmall">NEVER</span> <i>arrive</i>.&nbsp; Once again I
beg to remind you that a majority of <span
class="GutSmall">TWO-THIRDS</span> of the Ratepayers present at
the Meeting settles the question of rejecting or adopting the
Act, and as by a strange blunder no Poll can be demanded, I
entreat you to be early in your attendance, and give a plumper
for this truly benevolent measure.</p>
<p>Let me glance for a moment at the Requisition to the
Overseers, signed by His Serene Highness Prince Edward of Saxe
Weimar, by the Minister of St. Mark&rsquo;s, by Lord Radstock,
four Ladies, the Editors of the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, and
<i>Lancet</i>, a Rabbi, or Professor, Doctors of Medicine, and
Surgeons; also by Mr. Churchwarden Carr, Vestrymen, and other
respectable Ratepayers, including <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Ernest de Bunsen, Abbey Lodge, Joseph
Grote Esq., Gloucester Place, S. H. Harlowe Esq., North Bank, and
R. H. Collyer, M.D., Alpha Road.&nbsp; Strange meeting of names
exemplifying as it does, that <span class="GutSmall">UNITY</span>
of design, on which the Chaplain of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn so
delights to dwell; it is a paper of no ordinary interest.&nbsp;
Let me gladly acknowledge subscriptions towards defraying the
expenses of promoting this great social measure.&nbsp; Mr.

<p>Gentlemen, As friends of Progress, of more Intellectual Light,
and knowing the bitter fruits of Ignorance, I trust you will
endeavour to be <span class="GutSmall">EARLY</span> at the
Meeting.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Bis dat qui cito
dat</span>.&nbsp; I entreat you to bear in mind that a small rate
for <span class="smcap">Libraries</span> or <span
class="smcap">Museums</span>, or <span class="smcap">News
Rooms</span>, if tax it can fairly be termed, is like the quality
of mercy,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;it
is twice bless&rsquo;d;<br />
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy
might.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let those memorable words, &ldquo;<i>She hath
done what she could</i>,&rdquo; be applied to you, and what ought
to be done for St. Marylebone, do at once.&nbsp; &ldquo;The night
cometh, when no man can work,&rdquo; and there is no knowledge,
or wisdom, or project in the grave.</p>
<p>Allow me to offer a few suggestions as to the conduct of the
Meeting.&nbsp; No person can take the chair as a right.&nbsp; A
Churchwarden, <i>ex-officio</i> claiming the chair to the
prejudice of the Rector, is indeed an anomaly.&nbsp; You must
elect a Chairman, uninfluenced by Party spirit, for on your
choice of the right man very much will depend.&nbsp; I have known
Churchwardens, chairmen of Library Meetings who had never read
the Act, and knew or cared nothing of its scope and tendency, and
yet in the shallow guise of &ldquo;friends of the Poor,&rdquo;
and to gain a little fleeting applause, have not scrupled, to get
out of the difficulty to misrepresent or abuse it, or condemn it
with faint praise.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in stating that the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>Resolution
will probably be moved by that earnest friend of the working
classes W. J. <span class="smcap">Fox</span> Esq., and that it
will be seconded or supported by the <span class="smcap">Rev. J.
M. Bellew</span>.&nbsp; To hear two such advocates of Libraries
for the People is of itself a treat of no ordinary kind.&nbsp;
The great anti-corn law speeches of Mr. Fox are not forgotten,
and I am sure the honourable member for Oldham on so congenial a
topic as the Instruction of All, will not fail to please.&nbsp;
The crowded Church of St. Mark attests <span class="smcap">Mr.
Bellew&rsquo;s</span> well deserved popularity, and that
neglected art among clergymen&mdash;the art of <span
class="GutSmall">READING</span>, the reverend gentleman has
attained to perfection.&nbsp; I could not but think as Mr. Bellew
read the twelfth chapter of St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the
Romans, that it would be well for the Church if there were more
such splendid Readers, and eloquent Preachers, and if in the
Ordering of Deacons, the Bishop put the question to every
Candidate for Orders, &ldquo;Can you read?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Have
you passed your examination in the Art of Reading?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To opponents I would say are you content to be taxed
&pound;70,000 a year for Expenditure at the Workhouse?&nbsp; At
the utmost a &pound;2000 Library Rate would be required from the
large body of ratepayers, which is not worth consideration, and
which would be saved over and over again in the improved habits
of the people.&nbsp; Exercise then a little <i>commercial
foresight</i>, and you will perceive that it is a <i>good
investment</i> and will prove an economical Institution.</p>
<p>I should like to see the Proposal to open to the people the
portals to enter into communion with the good, the witty, and the
wise, carried by a unanimous vote.&nbsp; At the recent Birmingham
Meeting, Mr. Gameson opposed, but could scarcely obtain a
hearing, for the 1500 Burgesses were in no humour to listen to
his worn out, used up fallacies; and to Mr. Dawson was left the
not difficult task of reply, who in the course of an amusing
speech said that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;whenever he could hear of a rate that was
to be spent for a good purpose, he took as much pleasure in
advocating it as in tickling up a lazy ox with a goad.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mayor, Thomas Lloyd Esq., said that nothing <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>could
possibly be more gratifying to him during his term of office than
to have presided over a Meeting at which the Public
Libraries&rsquo; Act had been adopted. <a
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p>Gentlemen, I am desirous you should notice this amended Act,
under which Parishes can take a vote, provides not only for <span
class="smcap">Libraries</span> and <span
class="smcap">Museums</span>, but also for <span
class="smcap">News Rooms</span>, and that the general management
is vested in Ratepayers, &ldquo;not less than Three nor more than
Nine,&rdquo; appointed by the Vestry, and that one third of such
Commissioners go out of office yearly&mdash;I hope the Vestry
will not select the nine from their own body, but will appoint at
least four Ratepayers who are <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span>
Vestrymen.</p>
<p>A local paper, prone to balderdash and babblement, noted for
its rigmarole, loose, hyperbolical language, indulges in a
jeremiad about the want of a Museum.&nbsp; It seems, according to
this mendacious journal, that the great hardship of walking from
Lisson Grove, or the district of St. Mary to the British Museum
in Great Russell Street, or to Kensington is &ldquo;desolating
hearts that might be bright,&rdquo; and that setting up a Museum
in the wastes of Marylebone by &ldquo;Government
friendship,&rdquo; or expense, is</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;unhappily a universal want; a want that
private enterprise cannot meet,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then with some insolent rant about Prince Albert, and</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;the evil
tendencies of our Parish Senators,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this low class Marylebone Mercury advises a run on the British
Museum Natural History collection, and so</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;preventing our
neighbours from <span class="GutSmall">ABSORBING</span> all that
is to be had.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well for the consolation of this miserable, mean print, and
the languishing and desolate in heart, pining for a
&ldquo;splendid museum at somebody else&rsquo;s expense,&rdquo; I
would prescribe <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>the procuring the Libraries&rsquo; Act for
&ldquo;promoting the establishment of Free Public Libraries and
<span class="smcap">Museums</span> in Parishes.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a
Museum is a &ldquo;want&rdquo; in this Parish, which, with the
proximity of the National Collection and Kensington Museum, I
deny; you have only to adopt the Act.&nbsp; But I earnestly
recommend the not attempting too much at once.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Lending</span> Libraries and <span
class="smcap">News</span> Rooms are the great want, and <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span> Museums.&nbsp; Why will <span
class="smcap">Mr. Roupell</span>, M.P., in advocating a South
London Museum persist in <span class="GutSmall">IGNORING</span>
Mr. Ewart&rsquo;s <i>Museum&rsquo;s</i> Act?&nbsp; Why this
anxiety to rob the National Museum?&nbsp; Why this whining for
government aid?&nbsp; Adopt the Libraries Act, if you really
require a Museum for South London; but you want <i>News Rooms</i>
open to all comers, <i>not</i> Museums.</p>
<p>And here I am constrained to remark that Penny Journals are
not always vehicles of instruction in any sense of the
term.&nbsp; I regret there are not a few Editors in this great
Metropolis who have a special aptitude for lowering and degrading
Journalism.&nbsp; Take up the <span class="smcap">Daily
Telegraph</span>&mdash;to talk of the &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">MORAL</span> tone&rdquo; of this paper is
nothing less than ineffable bosh.&nbsp; Its exaggerated, ethical
articles, are nauseous in the extreme.&nbsp; Let me only refer to
the case of the &ldquo;ingenuous&rdquo; <span
class="smcap">Eugenie Plummer</span>, recently convicted of
perjury.&nbsp; With Judaic malevolence the <i>Telegraph</i> from
the first displayed great anxiety to criminate Mr. Hatch, who is
now acquitted by an impartial Jury.&nbsp; The desire to pander to
an impure taste, was only equalled by the base attempt to crush
an innocent clergyman, <i>co&ucirc;te qui co&ucirc;te</i>; and
even after the conviction of the precocious, marble hearted girl,
(who deserved a sound flogging as the only punishment she could
feel,) this cheap and nasty Print is at its dirty work again in
assuming guilt, and asserting that the unfortunate gentleman
&ldquo;did not behave like an innocent man.&rdquo; <a
name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; Serjeant <span
class="smcap">Shee&rsquo;s</span> is very dirty money, but this
<span class="smcap">Telegraph&rsquo;s</span> is worse.&nbsp; It
lowers a noble vocation, and sinks it to <span
class="smcap">Pressgangism</span>.</p>
<p>The critic of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> has a difficult task,
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>for its
nauseous, maudlin effusions, when wishing to be mighty fine, have
a bewildering effect.&nbsp; Its</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;No meaning
puzzles more than wit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Editor is evidently a nice man, with very nasty
ideas.&nbsp; Not the Holywell Street Press, not the most prurient
pages of Romance, can equal the skimble skamble stuff of its
virtuous indignation articles.&nbsp; The death of Lady Noel
Byron, the widow of the great Poet, is a case in
point:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The
creature&rsquo;s at his dirty work again,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The discretion of an Editor is never better employed than in
steering clear of the idle gossip and calumnies of the day, and
if there ever was a name that should be tenderly uttered, it is
that of George Gordon Noel Byron.&nbsp; It is a gross violation
of Editorial duty to bespatter, to assail with infamy, the memory
of a Poet, only thirty-seven years of age, who accomplished so
much, and whose early death eclipsed the gaiety of nations!</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Ruins of
years&mdash;though few, yet full of fate:&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why the <span class="smcap">Childe</span> will live as long as
the language endures:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Not in the air
shall these my words disperse,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now who are you, Mr. Editor of the <i>Telegraph</i>, and of
what faith, to impiously dare to scan the thoughts, and discern
the intents of the human heart?&nbsp; That power to scan belongs
to <span class="smcap">God</span> only.</p>
<p>You are told, on Divine authority, which no Christian
disputes, to &ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">JUDGE
NOT</span>,&rdquo; and yet you do not scruple to assert that
Byron &ldquo;was driven from his country, and deserved the
doom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Would the editor of the <i>Telegraph</i>, the
writer of this censorship, escape, if all had their deserts?</p>
<p>Why this wretched, Papistical jumble about the
&ldquo;adoration of Lady Byron by the serious world,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;reconciliation in the grave,&rdquo; and &ldquo;her prayers
having been heard for her erring husband.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I
hasten to dismiss this Pharisee of the <i>Telegraph</i>, who
daily reminds us that</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Dulness is ever
apt to magnify.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having so often discussed the advantages of Newspaper <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Reading, it
becomes a duty again to refer to such glaring misleaders as the
veering <i>Times</i>, which affects to <i>guide</i>, not to
follow opinion.&nbsp; The flood and ebb of public opinion is
carefully marked by this unprincipled Paper, and to every passing
breeze it trims its sails.&nbsp; The most signal instance of the
transparent dissimulation of the <i>Times</i>, is its truly
hypocritical expression of its &ldquo;great regret,&rdquo;
because the Lords threw out the Repeal Bill!&nbsp; St.
James&rsquo; Square, and Printing House Square, have coalesced,
and the &ldquo;Heads of Houses,&rdquo; Derby, Walter, and Co.,
must now be prepared to take the consequences of their
revolutionary tactics.&nbsp; No doubt my esteemed friend, the
Author of Festus, had the Shuttlecock <i>Times</i> in view when
he favoured me with the Portraiture of Newspapers.&nbsp; It is
far too sweeping an indictment, for the tone of the Press
generally is sound and healthy, always excepting the misleading
<i>Times</i>, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and <i>Morning
Advertiser</i>.</p>
<p>I will quote Mr. Bailey&rsquo;s clever sketch of the
&ldquo;great mercantile concern.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think if working men are to be led to
read at all, the Newspaper with its ill feeling, bad reasoning,
worse taste, fallacious assumptions and distortions of the truth,
is about the most objectionable school in which they could be
educated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking generally, the newspaper literature of 1860 exhibits
as much information, and more talent than can be found in modern
empty books with gilt edges, vellum, and morocco.&nbsp; The
Editors of the London Journals, with a few base exceptions, nobly
use their opportunities of directing public opinion.&nbsp; No
such vile journalism exists in this country as can any day be
found in the <i>New York Herald</i>, a one, or two cent daily
paper, owned and edited by the <i>black mail levying</i>
vagabond, and fugitive from <i>Scotland</i>, <i>James Gordon
Bennett</i>; a paper which does its best to fan the flame of
discord, by abusing &ldquo;the Britishers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
patriotic <i>Times</i> quotes the lying <i>Herald</i> as if it
were a reliant organ of the Americans, ignoring the fact that
this notorious Print is estimated in New York as the Satirist was
in London.&nbsp; It is curious that two persons, of unenviable
fame, the Scotchman <i>Bennett</i>, and a Somersetshire <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>man,
<i>Richard Adams Locke</i>, both of whom I well knew in New York,
in 1833, and who both left their country for their
country&rsquo;s good, are always described as
&ldquo;Americans.&rdquo;&nbsp; The great Moon hoax, <a
name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a"
class="citation">[38a]</a> &ldquo;Astronomical Discoveries&rdquo;
by Sir F. Herschell, at the Cape of Good Hope, published in the
New York Sun, was written by <i>Locke</i>, the degenerate
Englishman, who the <i>Illustrated Times</i> describes as an
&ldquo;American.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>New York Era</i>, edited and
owned by <i>R. A. Locke</i>, and <i>J. G. Bennett&rsquo;s
Herald</i>, appeared in 1834.&nbsp; <i>Arcades ambo</i>!&nbsp;
Arcadians both, suspicious characters both, these rival
&ldquo;American&rdquo; Editors abused each other in no measured
terms.&nbsp; I have always held it is the worst crime the
intellect can commit, to edit such vituperative Journals, and it
is indeed well for the community such worthless prints are few in
number.&nbsp; Obscure indeed, is the mental vision of those
Editors who cannot discern the iniquity of <i>misleading</i>,
instead of <i>leading aright</i> public opinion, who with pens of
ready writers, strive to make the worse the better reason; and
who viewing all subjects through the spectacles of Party, tell us
that &ldquo;white is <i>not</i> white, <i>nor</i> black so
<i>very black</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Talk of the <i>Times</i> as the
<span class="GutSmall">LEADING</span> Journal of <span
class="smcap">Europe</span>!&nbsp; If daily to utter unblushing
falsehoods, and odious calumnies, knowing them to be such,
constitutes <i>leadership</i> in Journalism, in this sense
[&agrave; la <span class="smcap">Heenan</span>, the Irish
American Bouncer] the <i>Times</i> is &ldquo;<i>The Champion</i>
of the World.&rdquo; <a name="citation38b"></a><a
href="#footnote38b" class="citation">[38b]</a></p>
<p>Ever strongest on the strongest side, if ever there was a
disengenuous untrustworthy arbiter of Opinion, it is this false
Oracle of Printing House Square!&nbsp; Why its leader, 16th May,
on &ldquo;the most extraordinary case ever produced <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>in a Court of
Justice,&rdquo; clearly denotes that I am <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span> an unjust Judge, in sentencing the
<i>Times</i> to be gibbeted as a wicked, misleading guide.&nbsp;
Observe its sudden changes of doctrine, and how rapidly it veers
from N.W. to S.E.&nbsp; Now that the balance of opinion has taken
a decided turn, and there is a distinct assent to the perjury of
Eugenie, and the innocence of her victim, the <i>Times</i> tries
to mislead and insult the judgment of the public, by representing
the &ldquo;ingenuous&rdquo; <span class="smcap">Eugenie
Plummer</span> as &ldquo;the daughter of <span
class="GutSmall">RESPECTABLE</span> and wealthy
parents!&rdquo;&nbsp; [Would that such
&ldquo;respectability&rdquo; were consigned to gaol, until this
&ldquo;wealthy&rdquo; Mrs. Plummer paid a fine of &pound;1000 to
Mr. Hatch, as some atonement for her neglect, and guilty
connivance.]&nbsp; Now the case is closed, and the verdict is
recorded, the <i>Times</i> is &ldquo;first at last&rdquo; in
making the discovery that</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;nemo repente
fuit turpissimus,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that no one, especially a clergyman, ever became lost to all
sense of decency at once.&nbsp; The &ldquo;leading&rdquo; Journal
can <span class="GutSmall">NOW</span> see clearly enough the
obvious improbability, and unreasonableness of the disgusting
accusation of two girls of established precocity, against a
clergyman of good extraction, education, and behaviour, who for
eight years had filled a responsible situation without reproach,
and against whose conduct, until this time, not a charge had ever
been alleged.&nbsp; Could not this &ldquo;organised
hypocrisy&rdquo; the <i>Times</i> (as Disraeli would call it)
have said all this at the first trial, and not cried</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;I warn&rsquo;d
you when the event was o&rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah! but this great Ocean of Print, the <i>Times</i>, is a
&ldquo;mercantile concern,&rdquo; and does not keep a conscience,
and sneers and laughs at the least earnestness in the Editorial
department.&nbsp; Perhaps <span class="smcap">Mr. John
Walter</span>, the Times Manager, and Chief Proprietor, by the
competition of an unfettered Press, may find out that in
Journalism, as in other pursuits, &ldquo;Honesty is the best
policy.&rdquo;&nbsp; That maxim is now utterly discredited.&nbsp;
Yet even at the eleventh hour there is for such a first class
moral delinquent as the <i>Times</i>, a <i>locus
penetenti&aelig;</i>, but as a sine qu&acirc; <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>non, the
Editor, or literary hireling, must abjure servility, and disdain
to become</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;A constant
critic at the great man&rsquo;s board,<br />
To fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here let me for a moment glance at Serjeant <span
class="smcap">Shee&rsquo;s</span> speech.&nbsp; Observe this Old
Bailey advocate is well aware of that most unfair rule of law,
which prohibits every person, and the wife of every person, who
stands as a defendant at a criminal bar, from giving
evidence.&nbsp; He well knew the discreditable defects in our
criminal jurisprudence, and yet felt no compunction in doing his
best to blacken the character of a clergyman who is not of
Rome.&nbsp; Let me tell this Q.C., who delights in desperate
eases, that as a member of that church which condemns priests to
celibacy, and consecrates the revelations of the confessional,
[that confessional, which thirty-three inexperienced Italian
girls have lately exemplified the use of,] he should have paused
ere flinging dirt at priests of a purer faith.&nbsp; The sentence
of the Criminal Court of Turin on Don Gurlino, an unparalleled
villain, Curate of the Church of St. Carlo, was ringing in his
ears, when Serjeant Shee deemed it an honourable discharge of his
duty to try and crush an innocent man, and load the Ministry of
the English Church with undeserved censure.</p>
<p>Let me tell Serjeant Shee he made a sufficiently bad
appearance in the case of Palmer, the Poisoner, and if his Church
so instructs him, he is badly advised.&nbsp; Let me remind him
that his countryman, Charles Phillips, as Counsel for
Courvoisier, was disgraced for solemnly avowing his
&ldquo;conscientious belief,&rdquo; in the innocence of a wretch
who had confessed his crime to him!</p>
<p>Nor in reviewing a case in which sound jurisprudence and
common sense have been so scandalously violated, a case in which
the most ignorant and illiterate jurymen, some scarcely able to
read, and unacquainted with the laws of evidence, are called upon
to pronounce judgment, the case of an unoffending man rigorously
punished, condemned without proof, by the bare word, without one
corroborating circumstance, of a precocious girl, who not <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>yet in her
teens, is mature and ripe enough in artifice and feminine
subtilty, illustrating what depths of duplicity exhibit
themselves in children who are carefully trained up in the way
they should <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> go.&nbsp; I am
anxious to &ldquo;improve the occasion&rdquo; by criticizing the
<span class="smcap">Bishop of Winchester&rsquo;s</span> share in
this cruel prosecution.&nbsp; If the multitude bear false witness
against their neighbour with thoughtless levity, it is not
becoming in a right reverend Prelate to play with the fire of
calumny, or lend his ear to suspicion, quite void of reason, as
if &ldquo;good name in man or woman were <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span> the immediate jewel of the
soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of what use is a Bishop, with a Princely
stipend, and a Lordly Castle, if he cannot personally investigate
the truth of a serious charge against a &ldquo;reverend friend
and Brother?&rdquo;&nbsp; Why condemn without a hearing?&nbsp;
Why this eager credulity of clerical evil without some
examination of the evidence?&nbsp; Why assume guilt?&nbsp; Why
this hot haste to consign Mr. Hatch to his ignominious fate, the
uncertainties of a most defective jurisprudence?&nbsp; Churchmen
desire some <span class="GutSmall">CHARITY</span> in Shepherds of
the Sheep; they do not indeed expect the simplicity of a Parson
Adams, in a Spiritual Lord, but they look for an example of that
charity which &ldquo;thinketh no evil,&rdquo; and which
&ldquo;rejoiceth in the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is a Bishop but a &ldquo;tinkling cymbal,&rdquo; if not
endowed with moral courage to set his face like flint against
vague imputations, and ignorant prejudices?</p>
<p>The Rt. Rev. Lord of Farnham Castle is energetic enough in
pouncing upon, and worrying Deacons and Curates, and can deprive
them of their licenses with a celerity not very edifying.&nbsp;
Why not exhibit equal alacrity in enforcing the law against the
Vicar of Camberwell, a Parish for thirteen years without a
Resident Vicar?</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Dat veniam
corvis, vexat censura columbas.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why clip the wings of the dove, but give the raven, or vulture
free course?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Dalton</span> has sent me some
statistics of the Liverpool Lending Libraries.&nbsp; Total number
of volumes 26,009.&nbsp; Individuals entitled to use the
Libraries, 8,594.&nbsp; Number of volumes lent during the week,
April 18th 1860, <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>9,520.&nbsp; The pleasure derived by the sick, and those
out of work, in being able to borrow books to read at their own
homes is constantly coming under the notice of the
Librarian.&nbsp; A person out of employment thus writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Were I to be deprived of the use of books
from your excellent Libraries, my life would become only a
burthen and a blank.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, My task is done, and it is time to bid
you adieu!</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Et vix sustinuit
dicere lingua Vale!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That word &ldquo;Farewell&rdquo; is always difficult to
pronounce.&nbsp; Once again I beseech you to <span
class="GutSmall">REVERSE</span> the decision of 1856.&nbsp; Many
anxious eyes near and far off, are watching how you will vote on
this occasion; do not disappoint their hopes, do not frustrate
the intentions of the Legislature!</p>
<p><i>Liberavi animam meam</i>.&nbsp; I have discoursed at some
length from the same text, but I trust, though unavoidably
discursive, you have not found me a tedious <span
class="smcap">Feilde</span> Preacher.&nbsp; Need I remind you of
the opportune reduction of the rates of halfpenny in the pound in
the Parish rental.&nbsp; If you look at this question only as a
Ratepayer, it must be gratifying to know that your money goes for
Libraries rather than for Dungeons, for the supply of Books and
Newspapers, <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> for the support of
paupers.&nbsp; Need I remind you how favourable to the cause I am
feebly advocating is the fact, that as a Nation we are <i>now</i>
enjoying unexampled Prosperity and unbroken Peace!&nbsp; If, as I
have shown, none should be entrusted with the Franchise who
cannot read or write, do not grudge a trifling rate which would
aid this great cause.&nbsp; Do not forget that a <span
class="smcap">rate supported News Room</span> is a step, nay, a
stride, in the direction of the <span class="smcap">Instruction
of All</span>.&nbsp; Yes, the time is propitious!&nbsp; The
course is clear before you&mdash;the race is glorious to run!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Farewell! a word that must be, and hath
been&mdash;<br />
A sound which makes us
linger;&mdash;yet&mdash;farewell!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not in vain shall I have addressed you, if on your memories
dwell some few thoughts that shall ripen into <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>deeds; not in
vain, if at the fast approaching Public Meeting the
Libraries&rsquo; Act is carried by acclamation.&nbsp; Not in vain
shall I have written, if I have induced you, <span

the Premier&rsquo;s Lord High Admiral of the <i>Sees</i>, not to
support his Patrons on a Field night like this is really too
bad!&nbsp; To give a vote which seriously impedes education, and
prevents the cheapening of School Books and Tracts, is consistent
in the extreme.&nbsp; But not only is it refractory, but
ungrateful opposition on the part of Lord Shaftesbury.&nbsp; A
nobleman so favoured by Lord Palmerston as to issue his

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
